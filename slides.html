        #A Basic Web Page: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

        **HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)** is a _markup_ language used to define the content.

        <p class="example">I'm just a paragraph.</p>

        **CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)** is a _style sheet_ language used to create the presentation and look of a site.

        <p class="example css">I'm a paragraph with <span>style</span>.</p>

        **JavaScript** is a _programming_ language used to define the behavior and add functionality to a website.

        <p class="example" onclick="alert('Clicked!');">I'm a paragraph that can be clicked. Try it!</p>

        #Web Browsers
        
        The main functionality of the [browser](http://browsehappy.com) is to present a *web resource* in the browser window. 
        
        Choose a modern web browser that supports current web standards and dev tools for a better experience.

        In [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/intl/en-CA/chrome/browser/) (and in other browsers), you can view the source of *any* web page. Right-click / two-finger tap anywhere on the browser and select **View Web Source**. That&rsquo;s HTML!

        **Chrome Developer tools** take it a step further and allows you to *inspect* any web page, making it easier to test & debug code. The tools can be accessed in a couple ways:

        * Option 1: right-click / two-finger tap on a web page and select **Inspect Element**   
        * Option 2: **Ctrl + Shift + I** (PC) / **Cmnd + Option + I** (Mac)

        #HTML Syntax
        
        Just like languages that we speak and write, HTML follows proper "grammar" rules too. HTML *tags* are written with a left & right angled bracket `< >` and the forward slash `/`. Get to know these keys!

        #HTML Syntax
        
        Tags usually come in pairs &mdash; an opening tag and a closing tag &mdash; to *wrap* the content.  Note the closing tag has a forward slash (`/`).

        ```
        <tag> opening tag --- closing tag </tag>
        ```

        HTML *tags* describe the content inside of them to the web browser.
        ```
        <h1>This tag describes a heading</h1>
        <p>This tag is for paragraphs.</p>

        To ensure that your tags are closed properly and help reduce errors, write the open tag and close tag **first**.
        
        Then move the cursor between the tags to add the text content.

      #Nesting HTML tags

      HTML Tags are often nested within other tags and make up the _document tree_. 
      
      The relationships are just like a family tree; branches of ancestors, parents, children, siblings, etc. 
      
      ```
      <parent>
        <child></child>
      </parent>
      ```

        Sometimes you want to leave notes for yourself (or others) but don't want it to display in the browser. Comments can be used for:

        * hiding code for later use
        * leaving notes
        * organizing the document

        The syntax for comments start with `<!--` and ends with `-->`.

        There are six headings tags ranging from `<h1>` to `<h6>` and follow a hierarchy. HTML is used to assigne *meaning* to the content in a way that the browser can read it.

        ```xml
        <h1>Name of blog</h1>
        <h2>Title of blog post</h2>
        <h3>Sub headings within blog post</h3>
        ```

        Paragraphs are represented by the `<p>` tag.

        ```xml
        <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
        <p>This is another paragraph.</p>

        1.  In the text editor, update your name in the `h1` tag if you haven’t already. (We'll talk about what `<header>` means soon.)
        2.  Add a tagline under your name using the appropriate heading tag.
        3.  Change the content in the `<title>` tag. Where do you see this change?
        4.  Add a copyright message using a paragraph (`p`) tag _inside_ of the `<footer>` tag.

        <!-- .element: class="note" -->**Bonus:** Try using an HTML code for the copyright _symbol_. Here are some resources:  
        [http://character-code.com/ascii-table.php](http://character-code.com/ascii-table.php)  
        [http://unicode-table.com/en/#00A9](http://unicode-table.com/en/#00A9)

        Don’t forget to save and refresh your browser after each change!

        #Creating HTML pages

        To create an HTML page, name the file with an `.html` extension.  
        Here are some best practices for file naming:

        * Use lowercase letters.
          * **about.html** instead of **About.html** or **ABOUT.html**
        * Avoid s p a c e s or symbols. Use underscores (`_`) or dashes (`-`). 
          * Note that [dashes are better for SEO](http://searchengineland.com/9-seo-quirks-you-should-be-aware-of-146465) (search engine optimization).
          * **business-hours.html** instead of **business hours.html**
          * The browser will interpret spaces as **business%20hours.html**
        * Keep your file names concise, yet meaningful.
          * **about.html**, **contact.html** instead of **page1.html**, **page2.html**

        ---
        ###Pro tip!
        
        These file naming tips can be applied to any files such as images, folders, CSS, etc.

        Your directory will now look like this:
        
        
        ```xml
        |-- project (folder)
          |-- css (folder)

        In the sample project, all the pages have the same headings (name & tagline), nav links and footer information.  
        
        The home page *looks* different but don't worry about that just yet. Right now we are still focusing on setting up the the HTML.

        ###Pro tip!
        
        It's best to write as much HTML & content as possible *before* adding CSS to ensure that the proper tags are being used. This will help keep your code organized and [semantic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_HTML).

        #Links & Attributes

        The navigation, in today's project, will link to the other HTML pages within the project files.

        Links are represented by the `<a>` (anchor) tag and an **attribute** to provide additional information. 
          
        The `href` **attribute** provides information about where the link is located and is added inside the *opening* tag. 

        ```xml
        Visit <a href="http://ladieslearningcode.com">Ladies Learning Code</a>.
        ```

        <!-- .element: class="note" -->**Note**: The clickable text goes in between the opening and closing a tags. 
      </script>
    </section> 

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>

        #Links: Absolute vs Relative

        This previous example used an **absolute** link. Much like typing a URL into the browser, it's "fully resolved" and starts with `http://`.

        ```xml
        Visit <a href="http://ladieslearningcode.com">Ladies Learning Code</a>.
        ``` 
        Hyperlinks can also link to pages within your own folder structure, referred to as a **relative** link. 
        
        Understanding how to use relative paths is important for creating web sites. It's used to link between any files in addition to HTML files, such as css or image files.

        #Relative path
        
        A relative path is relative to its place within the folder structure. Your project folder directory currently looks like this:
        
        ```xml
        |-- project (folder)
          |-- css (folder)
          |-- examples (folder)
          |-- final (folder)
          |-- images (folder)
          |-- index.html
          |-- about.html
          |-- contact.html
        ```
        
        To link *to* `about.html` *from* `index.html` (starting point), the `href` would be:
        
        ```xml
        <a href="about.html">About Me</a>
        ```
        
        To reference an image file, in the **images** folder, on `index.html` (starting point) the `src` would include the folder name like so: 
        
        ```xml
        <img src="images/filename.jpg">

        #Navigation menu & Lists

        Navigational elements are commonly created using lists. There are two kinds of lists: ordered (`ol`) & unordered (`ul`).
        
        ```xml
        <ol>
          <li>Ordered list item</li>
          <li>Ordered list item</li>
        </ol>
        ```
        ```xml
        <ul>
          <li>Unordered list item</li>
          <li>Unordered list item</li>
        </ul>
        ```
        
        Since the order of the list items in a navigation doesn't matter, an unordered list can be used.

        #HTML5 Sectioning Tags

        Sometimes, multiple HTML elements need to be grouped together for organization and/or for styling. 
        
        Prior to HTML5, the `<div>` tag was used for grouping elements. The `div` is still valid and used but HTML5 introduced a number of semantic tags that better describe blocks of content.  
          
        You've already seen two of them in **index.html**: `<header>` and `<footer>`.

        Writing code often requires a lot of repetition of content. Right now, the HTML in index.html contains content that will be required on all three pages (base HTML tags, header, navigation & footer info) and should be copied over.

        There are few different image file types for the web. Use the format that maintains the best quality while reducing the file size.

        **jpg** - used for photographs with lots of rich colours or gradients

        **png** - used for images with transparent or opaque backgrounds
        
        **svg** - used for 2D graphics and is very scaleable. Based on XML and can be used as a image file or in the HTML document. When included as HTML, CSS can be used to style the svg!

        **gif** - used for images with minimal colour variation and of course, for animated gifs!

        #Adding images

        Images are an example of a void element/self-closing tag. It doesn't need a closing tag because it _is_ the content.

        The image tag also requires an _attribute_ to define the file path of the image file. The value can be an absolute path:
        
        ```
        <img src="http://fillmurray.com/200/300">
        ```

        The alt text is read by screen reading software used by visually impaired users and also displays if the image is missing. 
        
        It should be a short description of the image.

    ##CSS & HTML

    Though CSS and HTML are closely paired, CSS is a different language and has its own syntax rules. 

    CSS separates content (i.e. text) from presentation (i.e. text colour) and helps to reduce redundancy.  

    Older presentational HTML tags like `<center>` and `<font>` should no longer be used because CSS takes care of presentation and styles.

    ##CSS Terminology & Syntax

    **Selectors:** Used to determine which element(s) to apply the styles to.  
    **Declarations:** Rules to follow & are written using `property:value` pairs.   
    Each rule must end with a semi-colon (`;`) to indicate the instruction.  
    All the rules for the selector must be contained within a pair of curly brackets `{}`.

    ```css
    selector {
      property: value;
    }
    ```
    **Properties** determine the type of style to be applied to the element.  **Values** are specific to the property. 

    ```css
    h1 {
      color: blue;
      font-size: 12px;
    }

    ##Cascading

    CSS executes from top to bottom (hence "cascading"), so be careful of the the order of your CSS declarations. The declaration that comes *after* will override the one that came before.

    In this example, what colour will the `<h1>` be?

    ```
    h1 {
      color: black;
    }
    h1 {
      color: blue;
    }
    ```
  </script>
</section>

    ##Inheritance and Specificity

    One of the strengths of CSS is styles can be inherited from parent to child elements using the family tree relationship between the elements.

    ```
    <body>
    <h1>My Website</h1><!-- child of body -->
    <p>This is a paragraph.</p><!-- sibling of h1 -->
    </body>
    ```
    ```
    body {
      color: blue;
      font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;
    }
    h1 {
      color: black;
    }
    ```

    In the above example, the CSS properties in the body selector is inherited by the children and descendants so all the text would be blue and display the Helvetica font. However, when a more specific selector is used (`h1`), it overrides the inherited values because it's more *specific*.

    ##Comments

    Comments in CSS are written within a slash & asterix (`/* */`) and closes in the opposite order. Comments can be used for the same reasons as HTML comments: leaving notes, hiding code for later and for organization.

    ```
    p {
      color: #cc0066; /* magenta */
    }

    /* HEADER STYLES */
    header {
      width: 80%;
    }

    /*  Saving this for later
    .slider {
      width: 100px;
      background: red;
    }
    */

    ##Referencing CSS

    There are three ways to include (otherwise known as *referencing*) CSS in an HTML page. Today we'll be using the **external** method. To read more about **inline** and **internal**, view [this extra resource](framework/extras-referencing-css.html).

    The external method links to a separate style sheet file and is recommended because it separates the CSS from the HTML document. Only the CSS file needs to be updated.

    The style sheet is referenced in the `<head>` of the document with a `<link>` tag and two **attributes**, `rel` (relationship) and `href`. Just like links, the value of `href` points to the location of the style sheet. 

    Though it is not required, css files are often saved in a separate css folder for organization, so make sure the file path points to the appropriate directory.

    ```
    <head>
    <title>Page Title</title>
    <link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; href=&quot;css/style.css&quot;>
    </head>
    ```
  </script>
</section> 

<section class="slide" data-markdown>
  <script type="text/template">
    ##Class Exercise

    In Sublime Text, create a new CSS file by selecting **File > New File** or use shortcut, **CMND/CNTRL + N**. Name the file with a **.css** extension.  Some commonly used names are global.css, main.css or style.css. Let's use **style.css** and add it to **about.html**.

    **Protip!** Sublime Text has a shortcut.  Type "link" with no brackets, then the tab key. Voila!

    ```
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/style.css">
    ```


    Let's do a quick check to see if it works and is linked properly by adding a background color on the entire viewport as a test.

    ```
    body {
      background: lightblue;
    }
    ```
    Notice that the content doesn't quite go to the edge of the page? That's because there's default spacing in the body element. 

    ![](framework/img/workshop/body-margin.png)

    Remove the test background color and replace it with `padding` and `margin` to reset the value. (more on these later)

    ```
    body {
      padding: 0;
      margin: 0;
    }
    ```

    ##CSS colour values

    **keywords** - use the actual name for most basic colours (red, green, blue, pink, etc) as well as a few fancy ones like "papayaWhip" and "paleGoldenrod".    
    **RGB (red-green-blue)** - Uses *three* numerical values from 0-255. 0 represents black, 255 represents white. See below for syntax.    
    **hex code** - Made up of the number sign (`#`) followed by six hexadecimal characters (0-9, A-F).

    ```
    /* These are all the same colour */

    ##Web safe fonts & Web Fonts

    Fonts can be changed with the `font-family` property. However, not all fonts are installed on all computers so it's recommended to use fonts that are considered *web safe* &mdash; fonts that are commonly included on most computers.

    It's best practice to list at least two or three font options to provide a fall-back option in case the user doesn't have the preferred fonts installed.

    ```
    body {
      font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;
    }
    ```

    Here's a handy resource for referencing web safe fonts: [CSS Font Stack](http://cssfontstack.com/).

    For more options beyond web safe fonts, services like [Google Fonts](http://www.google.com/fonts/) make it easier to add variety. Google Fonts allows you to link directly to their *hosted* style sheet and fonts and no file downloads are necessary. We'll be using this service in today's project.

    ##Using Google Web fonts

For more options beyond web safe fonts, services like [Google Fonts](http://www.google.com/fonts/) make it easier to add variety. Google Fonts allows you to link directly to their *hosted* stylesheet and fonts and no file downloads are necessary. To use these fonts:

* Select the fonts you want to use and **Add to Collection**.  
* You can **Review** them to take a closer look, then choose **Use** when ready.
* Select font weights. The more you choose, the more it will slow down page load time.
* The default character set should contain what you need. Only select an option if you need to add additional language support.
* Grab the `<link>` code snippet and add it the `<head>` part of your page.
* Use the new fonts with the `font-family` property as listed in the example on the Google Fonts page.

That's it!

  <h2>Lunchtime! (Optional Exercise)</h2>

  <p>Picking fonts is hard. For this project, we'll be using web fonts from Google fonts. Prepare for the post-lunch exercise by picking 2-3 fonts from <a href="https://www.google.com/fonts">Google Fonts</a> for the body text, header and cursive text. Here’s a <a href="project/final/about.html">the final project</a> for reference.</p>

  <p><strong>Need some help choosing?</strong><p>
<p>Here’s some inspiration: <a href="http://hellohappy.org/beautiful-web-type/">http://hellohappy.org/beautiful-web-type/</a></p>
<p>Or try Source Sans Pro, Quicksand, Merriweather or Codystar.</p>

<p>If you can't decide which fonts to use, use the example project fonts: Open Sans (light), Nixie One and Pacifico.  The font file links are provided in the post-lunch exercise.</p>

<div class="presenter-notes">
  <p>Aim to get to lunch around 12:15 - 12:30pm. A 45 min lunch is recommended since the afternoon covers a lot & more advanced concepts. Let the learners know this is optional but most people tend to enjoy continuing on a bit of exercises over the break. This will help speed up the next exercise and give them time to personalize their font choices without cutting into class time. If not, they can just use the suggested fonts.</p>
</div>

</section> 

<section class="slide">
  <h2>Class Exercise - Typography</h2>
  <p>In this exercise, we'll focus on just updating the fonts. Your pages will look similar to this:</p>
  <img src="framework/img/workshop/exercise4-fonts.png">
  <p>Right now, we've only linked the css file to <strong>about.html</strong>. Continue to check the updates on that page.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Pick 3 fonts from <a href="https://www.google.com/fonts">Google Fonts</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
      Add the Google font style sheet before your CSS file.

      <pre><code><title>Jane Smith | About Me</title>
<link href='http://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Nixie+One|Open+Sans:300|Pacifico' rel='stylesheet' type='text/css'>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/styles.css">
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
  In the sample project, most of site uses the same font throughout the page. So we can add the main font family to the <code>body</code> declaration block.
  <pre><code>body {
    font-family: "Open Sans", sans-serif;
  }
</code></pre>
Remember the family tree? Since <code>body</code> is the ancestor of all the elements nested within, these styles are inherited by the child &amp; descendant elements.
</li>
<li>
  Make the main heading (your name) a different font to set it apart from the rest of the headings. Since this style is going to be applied only to the main heading, use <code>h1</code> as the selector.
  <pre><code>h1 {
    font-family: "Nixie One", serif;
  }
</code></pre>
</li>
</ol>

    ##Combining selectors

    Sometimes you'll have more than one HTML element that share the same styles.  Target multiple elements at the same time by *combining* selectors in one declaration block. Note the syntax, combined selectors need to be separated by a comma.

    Instead of this: 
    ```
    h1 {
      /* styles here */
    }
    h2 {
      /* styles here */
    }
    ```
    Do this!
    ```css
    h1, h2 {
      /* selects both the h1 and h2 */
    }
    ```
    This does the same thing as the first example but with less lines of code and makes it easier to make changes to both elements.

    ##Exercise #4 - Typography (10 MINS)

    Add some more font styles. Take a look at [example 4](project/examples/exercise4-index.html) for reference.

    1. Link your Google Font style sheet & your **styles.css** file to **index.html** and **contact.html**. You will now be able to see the styles across all three pages.
    1. In the sample project, most of site uses the same font color throughout the page. Add the `color` property to the `body`.
    ``` 
    body {
      padding: 0;
      margin: 0;
      font-family: "Open Sans", sans-serif;
      color: #333; /* dark, almost black, gray colour */
    }
    ```
    1. Both `h1` and `h2` share similar styles. They both have uppercase letters and don’t use the default bold styles of headings. Combine the selectors to apply the styles in one declaration block. 
    ```
    h1, h2 {
      font-weight: 300; /* removes default bold styles */
      text-transform: uppercase;
    }
    ```
    1. Links by default are blue in colour so it does not inherit the `color` property declared in the `body`. To change the colour of the link, use the specific element selector (a).

    Make the color different from the rest of the text to indicate it’s a link. You can also remove the default underline with CSS as well!
    ```
    a {
      color: #bf6d50;
      text-decoration: none; /* removes default underline */
    }
    ```

    **Bonus:** If you have extra time, find an accent colour to use throughout your site and update the above color value with your accent colour. Here is the link to the [color resources slide](#slide42).

    Or, find a background image for an upcoming afternoon exercise using one of the links below or choose one contained in your **images** folder. Here are some resources:

  #The Box Model
</script>
</section> 

<section class="slide" data-markdown>
  <script type="text/template">
    ##What is The Box Model?

    The browser looks at every HTML element on the page as a box. 

    The CSS Box Model describes the way CSS styles the size and spacing of HTML elements. Understanding the box model is crucial for understanding how to position elements with CSS to create the desired page layout. This is one of the trickiest part of CSS, so don't worry if it seems confusing!

    CSS uses 5 properties to determine the size and spacing of these boxes:

    * `margin` - adds/removes space *outside* of the element
    * `padding` - adds/removes space *inside* of the element
    * `border` - adds a border outside of the element
    * `width` - can be set to a specific size via CSS
    * `height` - can be set to a specific size via CSS
  </script>
</section> 

<section class="slide">
  <h2>Padding and Margin</h2>

  <p>The <code>padding</code> and <code>margin</code> can both be declared using similar syntax of 1 to 4 values. Values can be declared using different measurement units but pixels or percentages are most commonly used. Setting the value to "0" will <strong>remove</strong> any default space on an HTML element. Any positive value will <strong>add</strong> space.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>4 values means top, right, bottom, left</li>
    <li>3 values means top, right/left, bottom</li>
    <li>2 values means top/bottom, right/left</li>
    <li>1 value means the same amount of padding on all sides</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Let's try changing some of the margin & padding settings below using 1-4 values and see what happens!</p>

  <textarea class="snippet" data-subject="#padding">background: lightblue;
    width: 500px; 
    padding: 0;
    margin: 0;</textarea>
    <div id="padding">padding and margin test</div>
  </script>
</section> 

<section class="slide" data-markdown>
  <script type="text/template">
    ##Padding and Margin (continued)
    Both properties can also be declared by specifying a particular side.

    ```
    padding-top: 10px;
    padding-right: 10px;
    padding-bottom: 10px;
    padding-left: 10px;
    ```
    ```
    margin-top: 10px;
    margin-right: 10px;
    margin-bottom: 10px;
    margin-left: 10px;
    ```
  </script>
</section> 

<section class="slide" data-markdown>
  <script type="text/template">
    ##Border

    The `border` property resides between the `margin` and `padding` and creates an outline around the element. It, too, has longhand and shorthand syntax.

    ```
    /* longhand */
    border-width: 2px;
    border-style: solid;
    border-color: red;

    /* shorthand */
    border: 2px solid red;
    ```
    Like padding and margin, a specific side of the element can be specified.

    ```
    /* longhand */
    border-top-width: 2px;
    border-top-style: solid;
    border-top-color: red;

    /* shorthand */
    border-top: 2px solid red;
    ```

  <h2>Box Model Review</h2>

  <p>This diagram represents how all these different properties work together to change the size of an element.</p>

  <img src="framework/img/workshop/box-model.gif" alt="" title="">

  <p>The original element started with a width and height of <strong>400 x 100</strong>. After including the padding and border, the <em>size</em> of the box is <em>actually</em> <strong>452 x 152</strong>! That's because these properties add space inside the element by pushing the content outward.</p>

  <p>Margin takes up space but since it's <em>outside</em> of the element, it doesn't increase the size of the element itself.</p>

    ##Box Model Fix!

Luckily, there’s a fix for this. Enter the [box-sizing: border-box](http://www.paulirish.com/2012/box-sizing-border-box-ftw/) fix ftw! This fix will allow you to add padding & border, without increasing the size of the box.  It pushes the content inward instead.

It is recommended to add this snippet to all your projects. By adding this fix, you won't have to worry about `padding` and `border` increasing the size of your elements. 

**Let's add it to our CSS file now**, to the very top of the file, since it's a global style.

```
/* apply a natural box layout model to all elements, but allowing components to change */
html {
  box-sizing: border-box;
}
*, *:before, *:after {
  box-sizing: inherit;

    ##Class Exercise - headings and spacing

    For next exercise, we are going to use `margin`, `padding`, `line-height` and `font-size` to update the heading styles and spacing of the content.

    ##Class Exercise - headings and spacing

    Now that **styles.css** is linked to all three pages, these next updates will apply to all of the pages. 

    Add padding to the `header` and `section` so there's an equal amount of space around the content blocks.

    ```
    header,
    section {
      padding: 20px 30px;
    }
    ```

    Remove the default space from the `h1` and `h2` and set the line-height. Add it to the the existing `h1,h2` declaration block.

    ```
    h1, h2 {
      font-weight: 300;
      text-transform: uppercase;
      margin: 0; /* removes default space */
      line-height: 1; /* tightens up the space between the headings */
    }
    ```
    Set the size of the headings **in the header**. We will use a **descendant selector** for this (more about this soon). We can also add a comment block for this section to organize the css.

    ```css
/* HEADER
-----------------------------------------*/
header h1 {
  font-size: 36px;
}
header h2 {
  font-size: 18px;
}
```
</script>
</section> 

<section class="slide" data-markdown>
  <script type="text/template">
    ##Descendant selectors

    Matches any element that is a descendant (nested tag) of the element declared before it.

    ```css
    p a {
      /* targets only anchor link tags nested inside of a p tag */
    }
    ```
**Protip!** Just like [Inception](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1375666/), don't go more than three levels deep.

```
nav ul li a span {
  /* NOOOOOOOOOOO */
}
```

Feel free to skip a level but be mindful of specificity rules. For example, `nav ul li a` would override `nav a` because it's more specific. It’s usually easier to start with generic selectors and make them more specific, as needed, rather than starting with very specific selectors and adding extra markup or classes to try to override the styles.

  <h2>Block vs Inline Elements</h2>

  <p>Right now, our navigation list stacks on top of each other.  That’s because they are <strong>block</strong> elements.<br>
    By default, some HTML elements are displayed as block or inline elements.</p>

    <h3>Block Elements</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>takes up 100% width of its container, no matter how long the actual content is</li>
      <li>will be the same height as its content</li>
      <li>always starts on a new line</li>
      <li>can wrap other block level elements or inline elements</li>
      <li>can apply sizing related CSS to it (margin, padding, height, width)</li>

      ##CSS Display property

      These default display styles can be changed using the CSS `display` property.

      `display: inline` can be used to get block level elements to line up side by side, in a line.

      `display: block` can be used to make inline elements behave like a block level element

      `display: inline-block` is the best of both worlds. Elements will line up side by side, like inline elements and also render sizing properties like block elements.

      `display: none;` will hide the element.

      padding: 0; /* removes default padding */

  <pre><code>nav ul li {
    display: inline-block; /* gets the list items to line up side by side */
  }

<p>Add some space around the links. It’s better to put padding on the anchor link rather the the list item because padding adds space on the <em>inside</em>.  Putting it on the link with make the click area bigger.</p>

    ##Being more specific - Using a Class

    HTML provides ways to attach extra identifying information to target elements in a more specific way. Classes are **attributes** than can be added to any tag and the value is define by you.
    ```
    <p class="classname"></p>
    ```

    The class can then be used as a selector to apply styles to *any* element that references the class attribute and can be used multiple times on the same page. 

    In CSS, classes are denoted by a leading period.

    ```xml
    <p>Regular text</p>
    <p class=&quot;special&quot;>Special text here.</p>
    ```
    ```
    p {
      color: red;
      font-family: Georgia, "Times New Roman", serif;
    }
    .special {
      text-transform: uppercase;
    }
    ```

    Another attribute, `id`, can also be used as a more specific CSS selector and for linking within the same page. We won't be using `id` today but read more about its CSS usage [here](http://htmldog.com/guides/css/intermediate/classid/) and in-page linking [here](http://www.webweaver.nu/html-tips/link-within-a-page.shtml).

    ##class and id Names

    When choosing a class or id name, choose a descriptive name and do not use spaces. Hyphens (`-`), underscores (`_`) and camel case are acceptable. CSS is also case sensitive, so while these three examples look similar, CSS will read these as three different classes so it's important (for you own sanity) to pick one style and be consistent.

    ```
    class="content-wrapper"
    class="content_wrapper"
    class="contentWrapper"
    ```
  </script>

    ##Class Exercise - Special text styles

    Let's create a `class` called `highlight` and assign it an accent colour. Try using the same colour as your links. Now, this class can be added to any element and it will apply this particular style.

    ```
    .highlight {
      color: #bf6d50;
    }
    ```

    Using a `<span>` tag, wrap it around your first name on the homepage and apply this class. You can remove the space between the first & last name, to appear closer together. We use the span tag to wrap the content we want to apply this style to, without affecting the content around it. 

    ```xml
    <h1><span class=&quot;highlight&quot;>Jane</span>Smith</h1>
    ```

    Now it looks like this!

    ![](framework/img/workshop/highlighted-text.png)

    Add this anywhere you want some highlighted text!  Your name is also in the footer. That would be another good place to add this style.

    ##CSS Float Property

    Remember, block-style HTML elements like `<p>`, `<div>` and `<section>` automatically start on a new line and stack on top of each other. That's why our content is currently just stacking on top of each other.

    ![](framework/img/workshop/about-not-floated.png)

    To get two block elements to align side-by-side, we've used `display: inline-block` for our navigation list, but the `float` property is often used for creating page layouts.

    **However**, we have to break the natural stacking flow when an element is floated. This will cause any element *after* the floated element to try to move up beside it or just not display properly because we've disrupted the natural stacking flow. The parent container will also collapse.

    ##Floating content

    For the next exercise, we'll use `float` to align the profile image and the text beside each other to make it look like this:

  </script>
</section> 
<section class="slide">
  <h2>Float & Clear</h2>

  <p>First we have to break it, then put it back together. We need to “reset” the float to get the rest of the page to go back to normal.  There are a couple ways to do it.</p>

  <p>One of the most confusing CSS concepts is when to use the different techniques.</p>

  <p>Let’s look at an example: <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/e1nd3q89/">http://jsfiddle.net/e1nd3q89/</a></p>

  <p><strong>Rule of thumb:</strong><br>
    If there is an element that <em>follows</em> the floated elements, apply <code>clear: both</code> to that element. If all the elements need to be floated, apply the <code>overflow:hidden</code> to the <em>parent element</em> to force clear the children.</p>

    <p>Want to know more about clearing floats? Here you go: <br>

      ##Class Exercise #6 - Update About page with Floats

      Add a `profile-img` class to the image tag in your **About** page.

      ```xml
      <img class="profile-img" src="images/profile.jpg" alt="description of image">
      ```
      In **styles.css**, add a new comment block at the bottom of the page for your **About** styles, to help organize your style sheet.  Then add `float` to get the text to wrap around the image. Also, add some margin to the right side of the image so there is some space between the image and the text.

      ```css  
/* ABOUT PAGE
-----------------------------------------*/
.profile-img {
  float: left;
  margin-right: 20px;
}
```

That looks much better but look what happened to the quote and the footer?! Remember, all elements that come *after* floated elements will want to float too, as long as there is space for them.  

Let's put the page back to its natural stacking order by *clearing the float*.  Put the `clear:both` on the `blockquote` element because that's where we want things to go back to normal. While we're here, let's also style the text in the quote and add some spacing.

```
blockquote {
  clear: both; /* clears the float and returns page back to normal stacking order */
  text-align: center; /* center aligns the text */
  padding-top: 20px; /* adds space between the blockquote & content before it */
}
blockquote p {
  font-family: "Pacifico", cursive;
  font-size: 25px;
}
```

Your page should now look similar to [exercise6-about.html](project/examples/exercise6-about.html).

<section class="slide" data-markdown>
  <script type="text/template">
    ##Positioning in CSS

    Sometimes floats and display just doesn't cut it for laying out page elements. 

    The `position` property can be used to place elements in specific spots on the page without affecting the elements around it the way floats do.  There are three options: `relative`, `absolute` and `fixed`. Elements are all `static` by default.

    `position` is used in conjunction with **offset properties**: `top`, `right`, `bottom`, and `left`. These are use to identify where an element will be positioned.

    To view more about positioning, check out this extra resource: [position relative, absolute & fixed](framework/extras-positioning.html).
  </script>
</section> 

<section class="slide">
  <h2>Class Exercise #7 - Positioning the Header &amp; Nav</h2>

  <p>Set the <em>entire</em> header to a fixed position so it stays in place at the top of the page on scroll.</p>

  <pre><code>header {
    position: fixed;
    top: 0;
  }
</code></pre>

<p>Let's check these changes on our <strong>About</strong> page.</p>
<p>Positioning also takes the element out of the natural stacking order.  See how the profile picture “jumped” underneath the header when <code>position: fixed</code> was applied? It’s because it doesn’t “see” that there’s an element before it, so it wants to slide up to the next available slot.</p>
<p>Add some padding on the top of the <code>section</code> element to push the content down below the fixed header. Then try scrolling down the page.</p>

<pre><code>section {
  padding-top: 125px;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Update the <code>header</code> css by setting the background to white so the content underneath doesn’t show through when you scroll the page. Also, add a border on the bottom to create a separation of the header from the page content.</p>

<pre><code>header {
  position: fixed;
  background: white;
  border-bottom: 1px solid #eee;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Why doesn’t the header go all the way across? When you position an element, it automatically becomes the width of its content. Set the width to 100% so it becomes as wide as the browser. </p>

<pre><code>header {
  position: fixed;
  background: white;
  border-bottom: 1px solid #eee;
  width: 100%;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Next up, position the <code>nav</code> to the top right of the header element. Since the header already has positioning applied to it, the nav will be relative to it.</p>

<pre><code>nav {
  position: absolute;
  right: 20px;
  top: 20px;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Your page should look like <a href="project/examples/exercise7-about.html">example 7</a>.  Note how the header looks the same on all three pages now.</p>
<p>Wait! The footer content disappeared on the home and contact pages!?</p>

    ##Home page styles

    The home page and contact page currently doesn't have any content in it so the footer is just "underneath" the header. Once content has been added, it will push the footer down the page.

    However, the final design for the home page is different from the other two pages so we'll need to create special styles for the home page. 

    Let's use the `class` attribute to create a selector to allow us to apply specific styles just to the home page.

    Add the `class` to the `body` tag to override any styles, for any element, contained within the entire page.

    ```
    <body class=&quot;home&quot;>
    ```
  </script>
</section> 
<section class="slide" data-markdown>
  <script type="text/template">
    ##Class Exercise #8 - Homepage Header & Nav

    These are the styles we are going to change to update the home page.

    * remove the fixed positioning
    * remove the white background colour
    * remove the border bottom
    * center align the text
    * push the heading down from the top of the page

    We'll use the new `home` class we created to override the styles by using a more *specific* selector.

    ```
    .home header {
      position: static;
      background: transparent;
      border-bottom: none;
      text-align: center;
      padding-top: 100px;
    }
    ```
    Now let's update the heading sizes.  Feel free to use what looks good to you. These are just guidelines.

    ```
    .home header h1 {
      font-size: 120px;
    }
    .home header h2 {
      font-size: 40px;
    }
    ```

    If you haven't already, add the `.highlight` class to your first name, to match the styles on the other pages.

    ```xml
    <h1><span class=&quot;highlight&quot;>Jane</span>Smith</h1>
    ```

    Your page should now look something like [exercise8-index.html](project/examples/exercise8-index.html), located in your examples folder.

    ##Class Exercise #9: Background Images

    So far, we've used `background` to add colours but it can also be used it to add images for presentation, not content.

    ```
    background-image: url(path/to/file.jpg); /* longhand */
    background: url(path/to/file.jpg);/* shorthand */
    ```

    Since our CSS file is *inside* of a **css** folder, use `../` to go *up and out* of the folder to link to the image files. Let's add it to **index.html**. Create a `.home` declaration block so this image only displays on the homepage and spans the entire page. (There are a few to choose from in your images folder.)

    ```
    .home {
      background: url(../images/background-6.jpg);
    }
    ```

    Notice how the images repeat (unless you have a really large image). We can change that with another property, `background-repeat` or just add it to the shorthand `background` property.

    ```
    /* shorthand */
    .home {
      background: url(../images/background-6.jpg) no-repeat; 
    }

    /* longhand */
    .home {
      background-image: url(../images/background-6.jpg); 
      background-repeat: no-repeat;
    }
    ```

    ##Class Exercise #9: Background Images (continued)

    The image is no longer repeating but it doesn't fit the space either. Your page should look similar to the below (unless your image is larger than your resolution). We'll need to add one more property to fix this.

    ![homepage background](framework/img/workshop/homepage-norepeat.png)
  </script>
</section> 

<section class="slide">
  <h2>Class Exercise #9: Background Images (continued)</h2>

  <p>Thanks to CSS3, we can now change the size of a background image. </p>
  <p><code>background-size</code> is the longhand property.  To include it in the shorthand <code>background</code> property, it <em>must</em> be included after <code>background-position</code>, separated with the <code>/</code> character.  </p>
  <pre><code>.home {
    background-image: url(../images/background-6.jpg);
    background-repeat: no-repeat;
    background-position: 50%;
    background-size: cover;
  }</code></pre>

  <pre><code>.home {
    background: url(../images/background-6.jpg) no-repeat 50% / cover;
  }</code></pre>
  <p>If no background position value is being used, background-size won’t work in the shorthand property so in this case, it may be less error prone to add it via the longhand property.</p>
  <pre><code>.home {
    background: url(../images/background-6.jpg) no-repeat 50%;
    background-size: cover;
  }
</code></pre>

<p>For good measure, since this image is a background image of the <code>body</code>, let's add one more rule to ensure the image covers the whole viewport and not just the height of the page content.</p>
<pre><code>html, body {
  height: 100%;
}

    ##Final Exercise: Forms!

    Forms are used to capture information from a user. The information processing and form submission usually requires the use of a server-side language such as PHP, Ruby or Python. But there are different services available to help do the processing for us without writing any of these languages!

    Let's look at the markup first.

    All forms begin with the `form` element and requires 
    two attributes, `method` (defines how the form will communicate with the web server) and `action` (provides the file path to where the form script is processed after the form is submitted.

      ```xml
      <form method="POST" action="path/to/form/script/processing">

      ##Getting your site online

      To get your site online and available to the public, the folder containing the HTML documents and related files (images, css, javascript files, etc) must be moved to a *server* that *hosts* websites.

      To move web files from your computer to a server, an FTP program like [Filezilla](https://filezilla-project.org) or [CyberDuck](https://cyberduck.io) must be used. You will also need to register a domain name (www.mysite.com) and get hosting. Here are some suggestions:

      * [dreamhost.com](http://www.dreamhost.com/r.cgi?2085384) - Domain and hosting - Use coupon code **LLC40** to get $40 off your registration!
      * [hover.com](http://hover.com/ladiescode) - Domain registration

      Why keep your domains and hosting separate? Learn more about Hover [here](http://ladieslearningcode.com/getting-hosted-domains-with-hover/).

      To get your files online, you will need upload your files to your newly purchased hosting server. There are a few pieces of information you will need and are usually provided to you by your hosting service provider.

      * FTP address (usually **ftp.yourdomain.com** or just **yourdomain.com**)
      * FTP Username & password
